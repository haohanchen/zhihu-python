如何评价中国无法成为发达国家？

China will become a developed country by 2150. I use models developed by Hari Seldon . The People's Republic of China will formally end on June 19, 2078 and its successor will rebuild China; this will be a gradual process and it will take three generations for China to get up to developed nation status. The most interesting thing is that after 2078, robots will play an important role in China's government, mainly because they are not corrupt.
